            Christian von Koenigsegg oversees the final preparation of the first Koenigsegg One:1 Megacar ahead of The Geneva Motor Show. The One:1 attains a power to weight ratio of 1 horsepower to every 1 kg of curb weight through unprecedented weight saving measures.
            The first to have the One 1 was, Carina Lima, who had the prototype that soon will have all other models have the same.
            The Koenigsegg One:1 model has set the fastest recorded lap for a production car at both Suzuka and Spa, it also held the record for the world’s fastest accelerating and decelerating production car. The One:1 is known for breaking the world record of the fastest car in 2015. 
            It’s one of the exclusive production car programs ever envisaged in the car industry. The car is the world’s first mega car. It was a limited series of just 6 production cars. It’s truly raised the performance bar and featured new, unique solutions that enhance track performance without compromising top speed or everyday usability, with unique track-optimized aero winglets. 
            The performance output is 1 MW at 7500 rpm - rpm limiter 8250 rpm. Torque is over 1000 Nm from 3000 to 8000 rpm of a max 1371 Nm at 6000 rpm.
