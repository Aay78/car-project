            In 2015 at Geneva Koenigsegg announced a new revolution, with the launch of the all-new Koenigsegg Regera. The Regera uses a system called Koenigsegg Direct Drive, which uses the electric motors to propel the car at takeoff with the combustion engine contributing drive from around 30km/h and beyond. They have their one engine made called KDD or Koenigsegg Direct Drive. An 1100 Hp of combustion engine power on 91 octane DIN or 95 octanes RON, with a 1250 Nm of combustion engine torque. A 700 Hp of electric propulsion of 900 Nm of electric torque. And a 4.5 kWh 800 Volt, flooded liquid-cooled battery pack. The combined are over 1500 hp or 1.11 MW, and 2000 Nm of torque. The Propulsion of the car has a twin-turbo aluminum 5,0L V8. A carbon fiber intake manifold with optimized intake tracts. The total engine weight is 189 kg (417 lbs), with a torque power low as 1000 Nm from 27000 to 6170 rpm. The Max torque is 1280Nm at 4100 rpm. Its aerodynamics is total downforce at 250 km/h 450kg (155 mp/h 992lbs). There are three types of tractions control of Wet - Normal - track. The wheels and tires of the Regera is a 2nd generation Aircoreâ„¢ super-light carbon fiber with central locking. 


Fun fact:   The Regera is the first car in the world that operates all body closures completely automatically, at the touch of a button. We call this system 'Autoskin'. Koenigsegg has managed to robotize the entire Regera with almost no weight penalty, thanks to the latest advances in compact lightweight hydraulic technology.
